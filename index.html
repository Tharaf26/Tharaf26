        Studies show that reading for pleasure makes a big difference to children’s educational performance. Likewise, evidence suggests that children who read for enjoyment every day not only perform better in reading tests than those who do not, but also develop a broader vocabulary, increased general knowledge and a better understanding of other cultures.Studies show that reading for pleasure makes a big difference to children’s educational performance.

        In addition, reading can be a fun and imaginative time for children, which opens doors to all kinds of new worlds for them.
